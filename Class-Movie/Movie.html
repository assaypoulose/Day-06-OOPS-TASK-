    <h1>Class Movie - Task 6</h1>
    <p>The class Movie is stated below.</p>
    <p>An instance of class Movie represents a film.</p>
    <p>This class has the following three properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>title, which is a String representing the title of the movie</li>
  <li>studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie</li>
  <li>rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG-13, R, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>a) Write a constructor for the class <code>Movie</code>, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.</p>
<p>b) The constructor for the class <code>Movie</code> will set the class property <code>rating</code> to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.</p>
<p>c) Write a method <code>getPG</code>, which takes an array of base type <code>Movie</code> as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of <code>Movie</code> instances. The returned array need not be full.</p>
<p>d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class <code>Movie</code> with the title <code>"Casino Royale"</code>, the studio <code>"Eon Productions"</code>, and the rating <code>"PG-13"</code>.</p>
<!-- You can modify the <code> tags to suit your specific formatting needs. -->
